# GlobalLogicAlgorithmTask
> Problem Statement:
Given the set of characters that compose the logic word (L, O, G, I, C), you need to implement an algorithm that
reads an input, identify words which contains any of the LOGIC characters and prints the frequency of those
characters based on the combination of LOGIC characters and length of the words. The frequency is how many
LOGIC characters are in each word divided by the total number of LOGIC characters in the whole input. At the end
you also need to print the frequency of LOGIC characters based on the total number of characters of the given input.
For both requirements you should consider words excluding spaces and special characters.
For example, for the phrase: "I love to work in global logic!", we see that the LOGIC characters appear 15 times. We
need to group them by combination of LOGIC characters and size of the word. We also see that our phrase contains
31 chars in total, however 7 of them are special chars so in order to compute the second requirement we take into
account only 24;
In this case, your algorithm would print:

{(i), 1} = 0.07 (1/15)

{(i), 2} = 0.07 (1/15)

{(o), 2} = 0.07 (1/15)

{(o), 4} = 0.07 (1/15)

{(l, o), 4} = 0.13 (2/15)

{(l, o, g), 6} = 0.27 (4/15)

{(l, o, g, i, c), 5} = 0.33 (5/15)

TOTAL Frequency: 0.63 (15/24)

(This is just a basic example of output)

Assumptions:
● The list of special chars are: ( !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~); (Yes it includes the blank
space :);
● The analysis should be case insensitive meaning that G and g count as the same char;
● The output should be displayed formatted to 2 decimals rounded to the nearest decimal for all combinations
(e.g. 1/15 = 0.07 and 5/15 = 0.33);
● The output should be ordered from the lowest frequency first to the highest frequency last (as in example
above);
● Words that have the same unique combination of LOGIC characters and same length must be added to the
same group, regardless of how many times the characters appear (e.g. “plate” and “level” both fall in the
same category: {(l), 5} and in this case the “l” char must be counted 3 times);

## General info
Intern task for Global Logic.

## Technologies
- JAVA

## Setup
Application provide two method of data delivery. User can :
"Choose data loading method -> "type" - for cmd input, "file" - for loading data from file: "

- type in String input and charactersLookedFor from commandLine,
"type" -> Provide string: "string" -> Provide character you want look for (as string): "charactersLokedFor";
- load this data from file -> "file"
